<p>
The introduction of the connected device (smart phone/tablet) has fundamentally changed the way we do, well, everything. From media consumption, to payment processing, to social interactions, our expectations for convenience and immediacy are changing. The power of our mobile devices is rapidly evolving, and with it so is core consumer behavior - merging not only online and offline behavior, but blurring the lines between augmented and…normal…reality. Healey will provide an overview of macro-mobile trends he’s seeing across the globe, reflect upon the insight eBay has gathered through its  headway in mobile commerce, and postulate on what the world might be like down the road.
