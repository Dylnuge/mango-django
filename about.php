					<p>Seventeen years ago, the student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Illinois (ACM@UIUC) held its first computing conference. 150 students from across the midwest attended the event, which was supported by 14 corporations.</p>
					<p>Since its beginning, the conference has grown to include the MechMania programming contest and a job fair. This year, we're proud to welcome you to the 18th annual conference from October 5-7, 2012, at the Urbana-Champaign campus. We expect to have over 700 student attendees and 25 corporate sponsors.</p>
					<p>ACM could not host Reflections | Projections without the generous support of our sponsors. Their donations fund all the events and help keep student fees low.</p>
